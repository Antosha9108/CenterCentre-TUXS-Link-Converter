# CenterCentre-TUXS-Link-Converter

Link Converter for TUXS Live Call

Built as an internal tool for a wev dev to create file name and link for
Live Call Notes.

Solves the problem of misspelling in the file name that causes the broken link for a pdf file and delay in posting live notes

OPTIMIZATION:
- ADD CSS
- ADD COPY TO CLIPBOARD BUTTONS (DONE)
- GENERATE FULL NOTE INSTEAD OF JUST PDF LINK
- CONVERT TO REACT
